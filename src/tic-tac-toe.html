    <p id="rules"> The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. The first player is known as X <br>
        and the second is O. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until <br>
        either oppent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled. X always goes first, <br>
        and in the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate is called a tie game.</p>
